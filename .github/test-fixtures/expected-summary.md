This policy mandates comprehensive encryption for customer personally identifiable information (PII). Key requirements include AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit, HSM-based key storage with FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliance, 90-day key rotation, MFA for key access, and complete audit logging. The policy supports SOC 2 Type II and GDPR Article 32 compliance obligations and addresses critical findings from Q3 2024 penetration testing regarding data-at-rest encryption gaps.
