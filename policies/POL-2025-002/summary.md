This policy establishes comprehensive encryption requirements for all customer personally identifiable information (PII) across organizational systems. Key requirements include AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit, hardware security module storage for encryption keys, mandatory 90-day key rotation cycles, multi-factor authentication for key access, and complete audit logging of all key management activities. The policy addresses critical security gaps identified in Q3 2024 penetration testing and directly impacts customer data storage systems, API endpoints, key management infrastructure, and compliance reporting systems across all environments. The policy supports SOC 2 Type II certification requirements and GDPR Article 32 compliance obligations for data protection and security measures.
