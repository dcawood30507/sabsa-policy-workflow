      "title": "Security Principles",
      "content": "## 2.3 Security Principles\n\nThe following security principles guide the design and implementation of customer PII encryption controls:\n\n### 2.3.1 Defense in Depth\n\n**Application to PII Encryption:** Multiple layers of cryptographic protection including application-level encryption, database encryption, file system encryption, and network encryption. No single point of cryptographic failure.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Layer encryption controls at data, application, system, and network levels\n- **Validation:** Each layer provides independent protection even if adjacent layers are compromised\n\n### 2.3.2 Least Privilege\n\n**Application to Key Management:** Users and systems receive minimum necessary access to encryption keys and cryptographic operations. Key access is role-based and time-limited where appropriate.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Implement granular RBAC for key operations, just-in-time access for administrative functions\n- **Validation:** Regular access reviews ensure no excessive key management privileges\n\n### 2.3.3 Separation of Duties\n\n**Application to Cryptographic Operations:** Critical key management functions require multiple authorized individuals. Key generation, deployment, and destruction follow dual-control procedures.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Require multiple approvers for key lifecycle operations, separate roles for key creation and activation\n- **Validation:** No single individual can compromise the entire key management system\n\n### 2.3.4 Fail Secure\n\n**Application to Encryption Systems:** When encryption services fail, systems default to denying access to protected data rather than exposing unencrypted information.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Configure systems to halt operations when encryption is unavailable, implement secure failure modes\n- **Validation:** System failures do not result in plaintext data exposure\n\n### 2.3.5 Zero Trust\n\n**Application to Data Protection:** Never assume trust based on network location or previous authentication. Continuously verify identity and authorization for access to encrypted customer data.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Implement continuous authentication, encrypt all data regardless of location, verify every access request\n- **Validation:** Data protection remains effective regardless of network compromise\n\n### 2.3.6 Privacy by Design\n\n**Application to Customer PII:** Embed privacy protection and data minimization into encryption system design from the beginning rather than as an afterthought.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data elements, support data deletion through cryptographic erasure\n- **Validation:** Encryption systems support GDPR right to be forgotten and data minimization requirements\n\n### 2.3.7 Cryptographic Agility\n\n**Application to Encryption Standards:** Design systems to support algorithm updates and key rotation without major architectural changes.\n\n- **Implementation Guidance:** Use abstracted cryptographic interfaces, support multiple encryption algorithms simultaneously\n- **Validation:** Systems can adapt to evolving cryptographic standards and threat landscape",
