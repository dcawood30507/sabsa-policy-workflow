# Policy Summary

**Policy ID:** POL-2025-004
**Generated:** 2025-12-27T15:52:35Z

This policy mandates comprehensive encryption controls for customer personally identifiable information (PII) across all organizational environments. Key requirements include AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit, hardware security module storage for encryption keys, mandatory 90-day key rotation cycles, multi-factor authentication for key access, and complete audit logging of all key-related activities. The policy applies to customer data storage systems, API endpoints transmitting PII, key management infrastructure, and compliance reporting systems across production, staging, and development environments. The policy supports SOC 2 Type II certification requirements and GDPR Article 32 compliance obligations, directly addressing critical findings from Q3 2024 penetration testing regarding data-at-rest encryption gaps and insufficient key management controls.
