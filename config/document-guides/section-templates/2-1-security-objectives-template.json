(2) Protect encryption keys from unauthorized disclosure through isolation and access controls. **Integrity Objectives**: (1) Maintain data integrity of customer PII through cryptographic hashing and validation. (2) Ensure encryption key integrity through tamper-resistant hardware security modules. **Availability Objectives**: (1) Maintain 99.9% uptime for encryption services to support business continuity requirements from Success Criteria (1-4). **Accountability Objectives**: (1) Provide comprehensive audit trail of all cryptographic operations for compliance verification and incident investigation."
