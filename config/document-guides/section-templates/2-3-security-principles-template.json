      "example": "This section establishes **Security Principles** that guide all security design decisions for this policy. Principles provide prescriptive guidance ensuring consistent implementation across all architectural layers while supporting Security Objectives (2-1). Each principle includes a clear statement, rationale explaining WHY it matters, and application guidance describing HOW to apply it. Principles are organized into three categories: **Fundamental Principles** (core security tenets), **Design Principles** (architecture guidance), and **Operational Principles** (ongoing management guidance)."

        "How should fundamental principles be applied?"
      ],
      "example": "**Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect customer PII, ensuring no single control failure compromises confidentiality. **Rationale**: Aligns with NIST SP 800-53 defense-in-depth strategy and supports Confidentiality Objectives (2-1) by providing redundant protection. **Application**: Combine encryption-at-rest, encryption-in-transit, access controls, and audit logging to create layered protection. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions for cryptographic operations, limiting blast radius of credential compromise. **Rationale**: Implements NIST CSF PR.AC-4 and mitigates unauthorized access risks from Risk Context (1-3). **Application**: Use role-based access control with time-limited credentials; separate read-only audit access from write access to encryption keys. **Separation of Duties**: Separate key administration, cryptographic operations, and audit functions to prevent single-person compromise. **Rationale**: Supports SOC 2 CC6.2 requirements from Business Drivers (1-2). **Application**: Require different individuals for key generation, key approval, and audit review roles."

        "What trade-offs do design principles require?",
        "How do design principles support objectives and services?"
      ],
      "example": "**Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach for all cryptographic operations. **Rationale**: Aligns with NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture and supports Security Objectives (2-1) for continuous verification. **Application**: Implement continuous authentication and authorization for all key access; never trust based on network location. **Assume Breach**: Design security architecture assuming adversaries have compromised perimeter defenses. **Rationale**: Supports Incident Response Services (2-2) by prioritizing detection and response capabilities. **Application**: Implement comprehensive audit logging and anomaly detection to identify compromised credentials quickly. **Secure by Default**: Configure all systems with strongest security settings enabled by default, requiring explicit actions to reduce security posture. **Rationale**: Reduces configuration drift risks identified in Constraints (1-5). **Application**: Enable AES-256 encryption by default; require documented exception process to use weaker controls."

        "How do principles balance security with operational efficiency?"

      "example": "**Automation First**: Automate security controls wherever possible to reduce human error and operational overhead. **Rationale**: Addresses operational constraints from Constraints (1-5) and supports Success Criteria (1-4) for 100% automated key rotation. **Application**: Automate encryption key rotation, compliance validation, and audit log analysis; minimize manual security operations. **Continuous Validation**: Continuously validate encryption coverage and key rotation compliance rather than periodic point-in-time assessments. **Rationale**: Supports Compliance Monitoring Services (2-2) and SOC 2 Type II requirements. **Application**: Implement automated daily scans for unencrypted PII; alert on policy violations within 15 minutes. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Base security decisions on measurable evidence (logs, metrics, test results) rather than assumptions. **Rationale**: Supports audit requirements from Business Drivers (1-2) and enables objective risk assessment. **Application**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs for all cryptographic operations; use metrics dashboards to track objective achievement from Security Objectives (2-1)."

      ],
      "example": "**Common Conflicts**: Defense-in-depth (multiple controls) vs. operational efficiency (simplicity); least privilege (restricted access) vs. availability (rapid access for incident response). **Resolution Guidance**: Prioritize principles in order: (1) Fundamental principles (defense-in-depth, least privilege), (2) Design principles (zero trust, secure by default), (3) Operational principles (automation, continuous validation). When conflicts arise between equal-priority principles, escalate to security architecture review board with documented rationale for recommended approach. **Documentation**: All principle trade-off decisions must be documented in design reviews with explicit rationale referencing Security Objectives (2-1) and Risk Context (1-3)."
