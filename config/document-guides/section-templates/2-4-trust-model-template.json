  "purpose": "Defines the trust boundaries, trust relationships, and trust verification mechanisms that establish who trusts whom, where trust transitions occur, and how trust is verified and maintained",

    "introduction": {
      "purpose": "Establish the trust architecture framework and its relationship to security principles",
      "elements": ["trust_model_overview", "zero_trust_context", "scope_statement"],
      "wordCount": {"min": 50, "max": 100},
      "example": "This section defines the **Trust Model** that establishes trust boundaries, trust relationships, and verification mechanisms for cryptographic operations protecting customer PII. The model implements **Zero Trust Architecture** principles from Security Principles (2-3), operating under the assumption that no entity (user, device, or network) is inherently trusted. Trust is explicitly verified at every access request using strong authentication, continuous authorization, and comprehensive audit logging aligned with Security Services (2-2). Trust boundaries are defined to isolate high-value cryptographic assets (encryption keys, PII data) from lower-trust domains."
    },
    "trustBoundaries": {
      "purpose": "Define where trust transitions occur in the architecture",
      "elements": ["boundary_definitions", "boundary_enforcement", "trust_zones"],
      "wordCount": {"min": 100, "max": 200},
      "guidingQuestions": [
        "Where are the trust boundaries in the architecture?",
        "What assets exist within each trust zone?",
        "How are trust boundaries enforced?",
        "What happens when crossing trust boundaries?"
      ],
      "example": "**Cryptographic Trust Boundary**: Separates trusted cryptographic operations (encryption, decryption, key management) from untrusted data processing environments. **Enforcement**: Hardware security modules (HSMs) provide cryptographic isolation; API gateway enforces authentication before granting cryptographic access. **Key Management Trust Zone**: Highest trust zone containing encryption key lifecycle operations (generation, storage, rotation, destruction). **Assets**: Master encryption keys, key encryption keys, audit signing keys. **Access Requirements**: Multi-factor authentication, hardware token, privileged access management (PAM) system approval, comprehensive audit logging per Security Services (2-2). **Production Data Trust Zone**: High trust zone containing encrypted customer PII. **Assets**: Production databases, application servers, API endpoints. **Access Requirements**: Service accounts with least-privilege permissions, encryption-in-transit using TLS 1.2+, encryption-at-rest using AES-256. **Non-Production Trust Zone**: Lower trust zone for development and testing. **Assets**: Synthetic test data, development environments. **Constraint**: No production PII permitted per Security Principles (2-3) secure-by-default principle."

    "trustRelationships": {
      "purpose": "Define who trusts whom and under what conditions",
      "elements": ["entity_relationships", "trust_conditions", "trust_levels"],

      "guidingQuestions": [
        "What entities exist in the architecture?",
        "Who trusts whom and why?",
        "What conditions must be satisfied for trust?",
        "How are different trust levels defined?"
      ],
      "example": "**HSM Trust Relationship**: Application servers trust the HSM as the root of trust for all cryptographic operations, conditional on mutual TLS authentication and valid service account credentials verified by Identity Services (2-2). HSM trusts application servers only after validating cryptographic signatures on API requests. **User Trust Relationship**: Administrative users are granted conditional trust to manage encryption keys based on: (1) Multi-factor authentication success, (2) Active directory group membership validation, (3) Privileged access management (PAM) approval, (4) Time-bound access grants (maximum 4 hours). No persistent administrative access is granted, implementing least privilege from Security Principles (2-3). **Service Account Trust**: Production services are trusted to access encrypted PII after: (1) Mutual TLS authentication, (2) Service identity validation via certificate-based authentication, (3) Authorization policy evaluation (role-based access control), (4) Audit log entry creation. **Trust Degradation**: Trust is immediately revoked upon: detection of anomalous behavior, failed authentication attempts (3 consecutive failures), credential compromise indicators, or manual revocation by security operations."

    "trustVerification": {
      "purpose": "Define how trust is established, verified, and maintained",
      "elements": ["verification_mechanisms", "continuous_validation", "trust_maintenance"],
      "wordCount": {"min": 100, "max": 200},
      "guidingQuestions": [
        "How is trust initially established?",
        "How is trust continuously verified?",
        "What mechanisms maintain trust over time?",
        "How is trust revoked when compromised?"
      ],
      "example": "**Initial Trust Establishment**: New entities (users, services) establish trust through enrollment process: (1) Identity verification via HR system or service provisioning workflow, (2) Credential issuance (hardware tokens for users, X.509 certificates for services), (3) Access policy assignment based on role and least-privilege principles, (4) Initial access audit. **Continuous Verification**: Trust is re-verified for every cryptographic operation using: (1) **Authentication**: Validate current credentials (token, certificate) are not expired or revoked, (2) **Authorization**: Evaluate current access policies and time-based access grants, (3) **Anomaly Detection**: Compare current request to behavioral baseline (unusual data volume, access time, source location), (4) **Audit Logging**: Record all access attempts for forensic analysis per Monitoring Services (2-2). **Trust Maintenance**: Periodic trust re-certification: (1) Quarterly access reviews validate continued need for cryptographic access, (2) Automated credential rotation every 90 days aligned with Success Criteria (1-4), (3) Annual security training completion required for administrative access, (4) Real-time revocation via certificate revocation lists (CRL) and security token service invalidation."

    "trustAssumptions": {
      "purpose": "Document explicit trust assumptions underpinning the architecture",
      "elements": ["assumed_trust", "assumption_justification", "assumption_validation"],

        "What trust assumptions are made?",
        "Why are these assumptions necessary?",
        "How are assumptions validated?",
        "What happens if assumptions are violated?"
      ],
      "example": "**HSM Integrity Assumption**: Hardware security modules are assumed trustworthy based on FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification and physical tamper-resistance. **Justification**: Required root of trust for key hierarchy; validated through certification and secure procurement process. **Validation**: Annual HSM hardware audit, continuous tamper detection monitoring. **Identity Provider Assumption**: Active Directory is assumed authoritative for user identity based on HR system synchronization. **Justification**: Central identity source required for consistent access control; validated through automated AD-HR sync monitoring. **Validation**: Daily reconciliation reports comparing AD to HR system, alerting on discrepancies within 1 hour. **Network Isolation Assumption**: Network segmentation controls provide defense-in-depth but are NOT relied upon as primary security control per Zero Trust principles (2-3). **Justification**: Assume breach principle requires strong authentication and encryption regardless of network location."
